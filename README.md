# Socket Video Call

[![Made with Flutter][flutterdart]][flutter] [![Open Source Love][opensource]]() [![PR][PRs]]() [![Download][Download]][Download-Link] [![GPLv3 license][GPLv3]][License]

### An Android Application, made with Flutter :heart:, to implement video calling between peers on a Local Area Network (LAN), without a Server interaction.
This App is based on WebRTC with concept of Server-less Communication.

# Basic Concept

To implement a WebRTC communication we need a server to validate the SDP messages.
Since it's a P2P communication on a LAN, we can exchange SDP messages on our own, than using a server.
Hence, we use a simple TCP messaging on a specific port to send and listen for any communication and transfer the SDP messages.

# Working

- The Caller first initiates a call to a person by createOffer() method of WebRTC.
- Then the SDP message is sent to the peer by communicating through a port the peer is listening.
- The peer gives an Accept/Reject screen to the Callee.
- If the Callee accepts, then the SDP reply is sent back to the Caller.
- This will initiate the WebRTC call.

### Implementation Details

###### A Server and Client communicate with each other in the following manner

<details>
<summary>Server</summary>

#### A Server to listen on a port and handle incoming connections.

###### Steps followed by the server:

1) Initiate a port listen.
2) Send a `HELLO` command with User info (Name) to every incoming connection, wait for a `HELLO` command reply with info (Name).
3) Wait for a `CALL` command reply from client, if it's a scan for available peers, the client might close connection.
4) Next Action:
   - If user is already on a call, send a `BUSY` command and close.
   - Initiate a Incoming call screen to display to the user.
   - If user REJECTs the call, send `REJECT` command, and close.
   - If user ACCEPTs the call, send `ACCEPT` command.
5) Initiate RTC and then wait for the `SDP` command with SDP info from the client.
6) Send user SDP info to client with `SDP` command.
7) Wait for `DONE` command and send `DONE` command and close the connection.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Client</summary>

#### A Client to initiate a connection on a listening port of the peer.

###### Steps followed by the client:

1) Initiate a connect to the server with the specified port no.
2) Send a `HELLO` command with User info (Name), Wait for a `HELLO` command reply with info (Name).
3) Send a `CALL` command.
4) Wait for a reply command:
   - `BUSY` / `REJECT`  command - inform user and close connection.
   - `ACCEPT` command - continue.
5) Initiate RTC and send the `SDP` command with SDP info.
6) Wait for `SDP` command of server with SDP info.
7) Send the `DONE` command and Wait for `DONE` command from server and close the connection.
